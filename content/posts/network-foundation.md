During the workshop "Digital Research in Old Norse Studies: Data Management and Infrastructure Needs" in Basel, October
5-8 2022, organized by the working group
[Digitale Forschung in der Altnordistik](https://nordistik.philhist.unibas.ch/de/forschung/arbeitsgruppe-digitale-forschung-in-der-altnordistik/),
the workshop participants unanimously agreed that this exchange and collaboration should continue and be formalized.

We therefor founded an international research network **"Digital Old Norse Studies"**.

The aim of the network is continue the fruitful discussions we had at the workshop, to share ideas and data, to
collaborate on projects, to organize more events, and to apply for shared projects and funding.

The core of the network is of course to be in active exchange with, and knowing the relevant people personally. Other
than that, the network maintains a [mailing list](../../pages/mailing-list), a 
[GitHub organization](https://github.com/network-digital-old-norse-studies) and the website you currently are on.

If you are interested to join the network, please get in touch with one of the members. We would be glad to have you!
