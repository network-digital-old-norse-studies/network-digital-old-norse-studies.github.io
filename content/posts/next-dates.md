We will reconvene for two more network meetings in 2023.

The first will be held on November 24 2023 and is meant to be an open meeting for everyone to catch up on current projects
and talk about what everyone is currently working on.

On December 15 we will hold our annual board meeting to discuss where we currently are at as a network, what plans we have for
2024, and where we see opportunities for collaboration.
