Guðrún Laufey Guðmundsdóttir presented the searching possibilities on Handrit.is.

Handrit.is is a standardized database, all information are machine-readable and accessable through GitHub and openly acccessible with APIs and can therefore be reused in different ways and projects.  
The database offers three searching fields: Browse, Power search and an open search string on the main page.

The main emphasis of the talk was the different functions of the various search options and the challenges that arise during the registration of the catalogue data of the manuscripts. 
It is difficult to find the right balance between too much and too little information in the database, especially when focusing on delivering good search results.
The search results depend on the registration and how accurate it is and according to the TEI-P5 guidelines, as a standardized and precise registration is the key to a good search result, so the database can be used to its fullest by researchers.
