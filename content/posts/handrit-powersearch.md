Guðrún Laufey Guðmundsdóttir presented the searching possibilities on Handrit.is.

Handrit.is is a standardized database, all information are machine-readable and accessable through GitHub and openly acccessible with APIs and can therefore be reused in different ways and projects.  
The database offers three searching fields: Browse, Power search and an open search string on the main page.

The main emphasis of the talk was the different function of the various search possibilities and the challenges we are facing in the data registration. 
The balance between too much or too little information in the database and how we can give the best search results based on the data inserted. 
In the big picture it all depends on the registration. 
How accurate it is and according to the Tei-P5 guidelines, as a standardized and precise registration is the key to a good searching outcome, so the database can be used to its fullest.
