We just launched our web page. Check it out!

The website is hosted through GitHub Pages, and was created with Hugo. Isn't it amazing how easy it is to create
decent-looking websites and get them online... for free!

A detailed description on how to contribute to these pages can be found
[here](https://github.com/network-digital-old-norse-studies/network-digital-old-norse-studies.github.io/blob/main/README.md).
