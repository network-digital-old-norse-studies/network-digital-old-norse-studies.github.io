We are the international research network "Digital Old Norse Studies".

The network was founded in 2022 following a workshop at the University of Basel under the title "Digital Research
in Old Norse Studies: Data Management and Infrastructure Needs" with the aim to advance dialogue and collaboration
between scholars of Old Norse Studies working with digital tools, methods, data or infrastructure.

The network consists of a number of scholars covering a wide field of research, but sharing an interest for Old Norse
manuscripts, medieval scandinavian literature, material philology and digital humanities.

Interested?  
We are an open research network. If you want to be part of it, please do not hesitate to get in touch with one of the
network members.
