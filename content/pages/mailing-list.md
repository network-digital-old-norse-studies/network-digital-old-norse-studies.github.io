As our main means of communication, the network has decided to maintain a mailing list. We created a GNU Mailman[^1]
list which is hosted at the University of Basel.

The mailing list is not intended as a public newsletter but as a communication channel. All network members are
automatically added to the mailing list - but we aim to keep traffic low. No spam from this mailing list (we hope).

To send an email through the list, you have to be subscribed to the list (remember to use the same mail address with
which you are subscribed, otherwise it won't work). Given that, you can simply send an email to
`digital-old-norse-studies@maillist.unibas.ch`.

[^1]: The administration backend may give off strong 90s vibes, but hey, it works!
