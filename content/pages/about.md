## Aim of the Network

The aim of the research network is to connect scholars with a shared interest for research at the intersection between
Old Norse studies - mostly focusing on manuscript-based and material approaches to Old Norse literature and culture -,
and digital humanities in a broad sense.

By maintaining this network, we hope to achieve the following points:

- Share knowledge, ideas, and data; connect with researchers with similar interests.
- Have a critical and constructive dialog on the implications and influences of digital tools and methods and data on
  our research.
- Further the exchange between users and producers of digital research infrastructures.
- Plan collaborative projects and publications; collaboratively acquire funding.


## People

The following people (ordered alphabetically by given name) are part of the network:

I am interested in the online cataloguing of manuscripts, printed books, and paper watermarks, and in the applications of data science in bibliography and codicology. During my studies, I worked for different DH projects at HÍ and the Árni Magnússon Institute.

Sven Kraus

University of Basel

I'm a doctoral researcher working on translation and transmission in 13th c. Norway and Iceland. In my
research, I'm exploring ways of using methods like network analysis, stylometry, and graph based embedding
and clustering methods. This means to a large degree experimenting with those different methods and
algorithms to establish which of these can be used meaningfully in a 13th c. context.
