## Aim of the Network

The aim of the research network is to connect scholars with a shared interest for research at the intersection between
Old Norse studies - mostly focusing on manuscript-based and material approaches to Old Norse literature and culture -,
and digital humanities in a broad sense.

By maintaining this network we hope to achieve the following points:

- Share knowledge, ideas, and data; connect with researchers of similar interests.
- Have a critical and constructive dialog on the implications and influences of digital tools and methods and data on
  our research.
- Further the exchange between users and producers of digital research infrastructures.
- Plan collaborative projects and publications; collaboratively acquire funding.
